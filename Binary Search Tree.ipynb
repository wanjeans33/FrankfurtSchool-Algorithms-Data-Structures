    "# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Python and demonstrate its functionality. A Binary Search Tree is a data structure that organizes its elements in a way that allows for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. In this notebook, we will implement two classes: `TreeNode`, representing a node in the BST, and `BinarySearchTree`, representing the BST itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key characteristics of a Binary Search Tree are:\n",
    "- Each node has at most two children, a left child and a right child.\n",
    "- For each node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node's key, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node's key.\n",
    "- This property ensures that search operations have an average time complexity of O(log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by implementing the classes and then test their functionality."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've successfully implemented a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Python. We defined two classes, `TreeNode` and `BinarySearchTree`, to represent the nodes and the tree itself. The tree is constructed from an unsorted list of key-value pairs, ensuring balance through sorting. The `search` operation allows us to find values associated with specific keys efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Binary Search Tree data structure is a valuable tool for various applications, providing fast look-up and retrieval times. Understanding its principles and implementation is crucial for solving problems efficiently in computer science and programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is a starting point, and you can further expand it by adding features like insertion, deletion, and traversal. You can explore and experiment with more advanced applications of Binary Search Trees as well.\n",
